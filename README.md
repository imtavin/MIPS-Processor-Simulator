MIPS Processor Simulator
This project serves as a simulator for a MIPS processor, offering a platform to execute MIPS assembly language instructions in a virtual environment. The simulator supports multiple instruction formats, including R, I, and J, providing users with a versatile tool for learning, testing, and experimenting with MIPS code.

Features
Support for R, I, and J instruction formats.
Execution of arithmetic, logical, load/store, and branch instructions.
Visualization of the processor state, including register values and the program counter.
Step-by-step execution for a detailed understanding of the code flow.
Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Compile the code using a suitable C compiler.
Run the executable, and you will be prompted to input MIPS assembly instructions.
The simulator will execute the instructions and display the updated processor state after each step.
Feel free to contribute, report issues, or suggest enhancements. Happy coding!
